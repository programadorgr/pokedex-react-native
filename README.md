# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## ðŸ”µ Step 1: Install

Once you have configured your environment, after that you should proceed as with any javascript project:

- Go to the root folder of your project and run:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

to finish configuring the environment and project dependencies.

>**Note**: In case you want to run the application in the emulator, you must first make sure that it is running either from **Android Studio** or **Xcode**, this step is necessary before continuing.

## ðŸ”µ Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm run start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## ðŸ”µ Step 3: Start your Application

>**Note**: This step is optional, if before in step 2 we selected the platform where to run the application either **Android** or **iOS**, we would actually be running this same step (Step 3).

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## ðŸš€ Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your Pokedex App. :partying_face:
